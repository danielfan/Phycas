~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Release history (most recent first) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Release 1.2.1 (?date?)
- git tag = v1.2.1
- changed default value for ss.nbetavals from 101 to 21
- TODO: ss.pfile can be used to specify a params file from a previous run that can
  be used to estimate the reference distribution for the current run.

Release 1.2.0 (7-Aug-2010)
- partitioning implemented (tree topology and edge lengths apply to all subsets,
  and all other model parameters are subset specific)
- the ps command has been renamed the ss command to reflect the fact that the 
  primary purpose of the command is to use the Stepping Stone method, and ps stands
  for path sampling, a name that was never used even by the authors of the 
  thermodynamic integration approach!
- the mcmc command now has an option save_sitelikes which causes the site log-
  likelihoods to be saved to a file (name determined by mcmc.out.sitelikes). If 
  sump.cpofile is set to this site log-likelihood file, then sump will estimate 
  the Conditional Predictive Ordinate for each site
  - the process of specifying a master pseudorandom number seed has been simplied
  in version 1.2. You can now simply insert the command setMasterSeed(13579) just 
  after the "from phycas import *" command to set the master random number seed 
  to the value 13579.
- if mcmc.fix_topology specified, all branch lengths are recorded in the params file
  (otherwise only the tree length is recorded).

Release 1.1.4 (8-Apr-2009)
- harmonic mean estimate of marginal likelihood is no longer computed after an MCMC run
  (use sump command for this)
- several small bugs were fixed in the sim command (still some glitches left, I fear)
- the output of sump() when invoked after ps() no longer includes results using Simpson's rule
  (Simpson's rule for approximating integrals is too unreliable in the context of marginal 
  likelihood estimation and will no longer be computed by Phycas)
- ps() no longer issues the complaint "model uses an updater...that has not yet been added 
  to MCMCImpl.explorePrior" when using the default model
- bug fixed in TopoPriorCalculator class that caused it to sometimes return counts computed
  for previous number of taxa after number of taxa changed

Release 1.1.3 (15-Mar-2009)
- this number was used for some Python-version-specific Mac releases
  that are really 1.1.2 code

Release 1.1.2 (13-Mar-2009)
- subversion revisions for this release:
	1047 Mac
	1049 Linux
	1049 Win for Python 2.5
	1047 Win for Python 2.6
- fixed 3rd. underflow-related bug

Release 1.1.1 (12-Mar-2009)
- subversion revisions for this release:
	1052 Mac
	1052 Linux
	1052 Win for Python 2.5
	1053 Win for Python 2.6
- fixed 2 underflow-related bugs

Release 1.1.0 (11-Feb-2009)
- the subversion revision number for this release is 1020
- added the ps command, which does path sampling (a.k.a. thermodynamic integration)
  and steppingstone sampling (new method) for estimating marginal likelihood
- added sump command, which currently computes just basic summary statistics given
  a param file output from an mcmc or ps analysis
- changed model.base_freqs and model.base_freq_param_prior to model.state_freqs 
  and model.state_freq_param_prior, respectively
- added model.update_freqs_separately and model.state_freq_prior to allow joint
  updates of all state frequencies. If model.update_freqs_separately = True, each
  frequency parameter is updated separately by slice sampling (old way) and the
  model.state_freq_param_prior is applied to each one individually; if False, 
  the state frequencies are updated jointly using a Metropolis move and the joint
  prior model.state_freq_prior is applied to the entire vector of state freqs
- two memory leaks were fixed prior to this release (see "leaky" bug in BUGS file).

Release 1.0.0 (5-Aug-2008)
This was the first official release at the Woods Hole Molecular Evolution Workshop.
