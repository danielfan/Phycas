Installing Phycas

Windows

Python 2.4 or later must be installed before trying to install Phycas.
The first step is to unpack the zip file to a directory of your choice. 
We recommend using 7-zip (http://www.7-zip.org/) for this. If you would
like to drag-drop Python scripts onto Phycas, find the phycas.bat file
and right-drag it to your desktop, choosing to create a shortcut when
the opportunity arises. If you want to just play around, you can simply 
double-click the shortcut to start Phycas (without dragging a file onto it).
If you wish to invoke Phycas from any command window, you can set the 
appropriate environmental variables by double-clicking the install_phycas.bat
batch file. This need be done only once (and will need to be repeated if you 
move the entire Phycas directory somewhere else). 

MacOS

For MacOS, we provide a Phycas.app bundle that is really iTerm with a 
Phycas payload inside. When you double-click Phycas.app, an iTerm 
terminal is started, Python is started within it, and Phycas code is
imported into Python automatically. The Phycas.app bundle can be dragged
to the dock to create an alias, and Python scripts can be dragged onto the
dock alias to start runs. You can also build Phycas yourself using the
instructions below for Linux.
