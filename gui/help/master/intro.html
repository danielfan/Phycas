<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The Phycas 
Software consists of two components – a backend Processor and a 
front-end Graphical User Interface (GUI).&nbsp; The Phycas software is used to 
perform of a series of commands, each with its own options.&nbsp; These commands 
are entered using the Nexus format.</span><p><font size="5">
<a name="GUI">Using the Phycas GUI</a></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The GUI consists of two windows – the main window and the 
output window.&nbsp; </p>
<h5>Main Window</h5>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">When the GUI is 
initially launched, the welcome screen is displayed in the main window.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This screen provides a text field for the user to enter a command directly.&nbsp; 
Commands can also be generated using its screen.&nbsp; Each command has a menu 
item on one of the menus in the menu bar of the main window.&nbsp; When a menu item 
is selected, the main window displays the appropriate command’s screen.&nbsp;When the 
OK button is pressed on that screen, the Nexus command string is generated and 
sent to the Processor.&nbsp; The main window then switches back to the welcome 
screen.&nbsp; If an error occurs in the Processor or more information is needed from 
the user, the main window will switch back to the last command screen viewed.&nbsp; 
Additional menu items in the menu bar allow the user to show the output window 
or the help window or the welcome screen, or to exit Phycas.&nbsp; The bottom of 
the main window contains the Message Area.&nbsp; When a field on a command 
screen has an error, its label will turn red and a message will be displayed in 
the Message Area.</span></p>
<h5>Output Window</h5>
<p class="MsoNormal">The output window initially contains a single tab labeled 
output.&nbsp; All output from the Processor is written there.&nbsp; If a command is issued 
by the user containing data that needs to be plotted, tabs will be added to this 
window to allow the user to generate trace plots of the data returned by the 
Processor.&nbsp; The output window can be closed without exiting Phycas.&nbsp; The menu 
bar of this window contains options for saving and clearing the output text, and 
for printing, saving, closing, and editing the properties of graphs.&nbsp; Most of 
these actions can also be performed using a popup menu, which is made visible by 
right-clicking the mouse in either the output text area or on a graph.&nbsp; </p>
