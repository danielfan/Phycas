...likelihood_pymod.cpp(146) : fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR

A Microsoft Visual Studio internal compiler error occuring during compilation of
a *_pymod.cpp file seems to mean that you have forgotten to include the header
file for the class you are trying to wrap. This seems to occur when forward
declarations of the class (and its corresponding sharet_ptr type) are available
but the actual definition of the class is unknown. In the example above, I was
trying to wrap the phycas::SimData class like this

	class_<phycas::SimData, boost::noncopyable
			, boost::shared_ptr<phycas::SimData> >("SimDataBase")
		.def("saveToNexusFile", &phycas::SimData::saveToNexusFile)
		;

but failed to include pyphy/likelihood/sim_data.hpp. However, pyphy/likelihood/
tree_likelihood.hpp included these lines, which may have deluded the compiler
into thinking that it knew more about the SimData class than it really did:

	class SimData;
	typedef boost::shared_ptr<SimData>	SimDataShPtr;

Function returns None in Python when it should return something (e.g. a string)

You are probably wrapping the C++ function by a Python function, but the Python
version of the function lacks a return statement, so even though the C++ base
class version of the function dutifully returns an object, the Python wrapper
functions returns nothing.

Linker complains about a function being missing when it seems to be right there
in the cpp file

Two possibilities:
1) there is an #if 0 so far above the function that you don't see it (scroll up)
2) you have recently moved the function from an .inl file and mistakenly left
   the inline keyword in front of the function's name
