This section lists all currently available Phycas settings. 
You will find more if you look at the \code{Phycas.\_\_init\_\_} method in the \pathname{Phycas.py} file, but be forewarned that settings found in \pathname{Phycas.py} but not listed here are experimental and not fully tested --- use at your own risk.
Please do not ask for help with undocumented settings: we will document them here when we feel they are ready to be used.
