~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Release history (most recent first) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Release 1.1.0 (?)
- changed model.base_freqs and model.base_freq_param_prior to model.state_freqs 
  and model.state_freq_param_prior, respectively
- added model.update_freqs_separately and model.state_freq_prior to allow joint
  updates of all state frequencies. If model.update_freqs_separately = True, each
  frequency parameter is updated separately by slice sampling (old way) and the
  model.state_freq_param_prior is applied to each one individually; if False, 
  the state frequencies are updated jointly using a Metropolis move and the joint
  prior model.state_freq_prior is applied to the entire vector of state freqs.

Release 1.0.0 (5-Aug-2008)
This was the first official release at the Woods Hole Molecular Evolution Workshop.
