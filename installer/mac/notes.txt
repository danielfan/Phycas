Mac installer notes
===================

Overview
--------

The script build_mac_installer.sh orchestrates everything, so the
best way to learn about the process is to study that file.

The ultimate goal is a disk image (dmg file) containing a metapackage.

The metapackage contains three component packages:
- libBoost.pkg
- Phycas.pkg
- PhycasAppsFolder.pkg

libBoost.pkg installs the Boost dynamic library to /usr/local/lib

Phycas.pkg installs the phycas directory, which contains all the
Python source code, C++ shared libraries, examples, and tests, to
the site-packages directory of the Python installation.

PhycasAppsFolder.pkg installs the manual and several applescript
applications (StartPhycas, ExamplesFolder and RunTests) to a 
folder named Phycas inside the user's Applications folder.

Cleaning the slate
------------------
The file macDeveloperUninstall.sh does not currently work (too
much has changed about the process since this file was created).
Here is an applescript that removes all traces of the installation
(you will have to change the paths of course):

set ok to "yes"
try
	set d to display dialog "sudo password:" default answer "" with hidden answer
on error errText number errNumber
	if (errNumber is equal to -128) then
		-- User pressed Cancel button
		set ok to "no"
	end if
end try

if ok is equal to "yes" then
	set pw to text returned of d
	do shell script "sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/libboost_python-1_34.dylib" password pw with administrator privileges
	do shell script "sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/phycas" password pw with administrator privileges
	do shell script "sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/libBoost.pkg" password pw with administrator privileges
	do shell script "sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/Phycas.pkg" password pw with administrator privileges
	do shell script "sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/PhycasAppsFolder.pkg" password pw with administrator privileges
	do shell script "sudo rm -rf /Users/plewis/phycasdev/installer/mac/stage" password pw with administrator privileges
	do shell script "sudo rm -rf /Users/plewis/phycasdev/dist" password pw with administrator privileges
	do shell script "sudo rm -rf /Users/plewis/phycasdev/build" password pw with administrator privileges
	do shell script "sudo rm -rf /Applications/Phycas" password pw with administrator privileges
	do shell script "cd /Users/plewis/phycasdev/installer/mac/diskimage; make -f dmgMakefile clean"
end if

Packagemaker projects
---------------------
Two packagemaker projects (libBoost.pmproj and PhycasAppsFolder.pmproj)
correspond to individual projects in the metaproject. The Phycas.pkg
is created indirectly by using bdist_mpkg to create a metapackage, then
extracting the Phycas.pkg from that metapackage. The final project
file needed is phycas+boost-i386-2.5.pmproj, which builds the final
metapackage.

Applescript applications
------------------------
The apps in the shortcuts folder were made using the applescript
editor (/Applications/AppleScript/Script Editor). 

They can still be edited by the Script Editor because the Run Only 
option was never checked when they were saved. 

These scripts were saved as application bundles so that they can 
be run by double-clicking. 

The icon in StartPhycas25.app was changed by deleting the existing
StartPhycas25.app/Contents/Resources/applet.icns file and replacing
it with the phycas-icons.icns file from the installer/mac/images
folder.

Disk image properties
---------------------
Although not used currently, the background and other properties of
the disk image can be modified by uncompressing 
installer/mac/diskimage/template.dmg.bz2 (double-click on it),
mounting the resulting template.dmg file, then modifying the 
properties of the mounted disk image using Command+j (be sure to
choose "This Window Only").
