Before first release:

o should use kappa_prior rather than relrate_prior for HKY model
  (see Examples/Paradox.py)
  
o  need default constructors for each ProbabilityDistribution-derived class
  (see Examples/Paradox.py)

o slice_max_units needs to be 0 by default - too complicated to explain in examples
  (see Examples/Paradox.py) 
  
o need to be able to restart an analysis from where it left off
