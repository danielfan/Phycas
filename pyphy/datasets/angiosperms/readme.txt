Downloaded NoWel.nex and NoWel.tree from http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/angiospermATOL/

angio560.nex appears to be an older verion of NoWel.nex that contains exsets 
  (not sure where I got this originally)

rbcl500.nex is from Derrick Zwickl, but looks like it came from Usman Roshan's
  Rec-I-DCM3 distribution (http://www.cs.njit.edu/usman/RecIDCM3.html)
