Welcome to the MacOS version of Phycas!

We recommend dragging the Phycas application file to your Applications
folder (and from there to your dock to make a convenient alias). 
Starting the Phycas application actually launches an iTerm 
(http://iterm.sourceforge.net/) terminal session. You can begin using
Phycas as soon as you see the Python prompt (which is three greater-than
symbols in a row: >>>). 

The manual.pdf file contains the user manual, which explains
how to use Phycas for Bayesian phylogeneic analyses. Inside the manual
you will find a tutorial, and to save you typing we've included a 
tutorial folder containing the scripts referenced in the tutorial.

You can get the latest version of Phycas from http://phycas.org/
