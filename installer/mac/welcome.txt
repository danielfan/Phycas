Installing Phycas
=================

How do I install Phycas? 
------------------------

Double-click the package file (named something like "Phycas-Mac-i386-python2.5.mpkg") to start the installer, then follow instructions.

What will happen when I install Phycas?
---------------------------------------

The Phycas installer will add files to three locations on your computer. Because you must have administrator privileges to write to some of these locations, you will be asked for your administrator password during the install process. Here are the specific locations accessed (in case you ever want to remove Phycas completely):

o The boost dynamic library file "libboost_python-1_34.dylib" will be copied to the directory "/usr/local/lib". 

o The Python source files and dynamic libraries that make up Phycas will be copied to the "site-packages" directory of the version of Python currently in use (for Python 2.5, this directory is "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages"). 

o A folder named "Phycas" will be created in your "Applications" folder. This folder contains three items:
  
1. the user manual ("manual.pdf")

2. an applescript application ("ExamplesFolder") that will open the Examples folder when double-clicked

3. an applescript application ("RunTests") that will run tests to ensure that your installation of Phycas is working correctly

How do I get started using Phycas?
----------------------------------

Begin by reading the file "manual.pdf", which (after the installer finishes) should be located in the "Phycas" folder inside your "Applications" folder.
