Data source:    Character matrix in memory (id 7277424) with 1296 characters for 10 taxa.  Characters from the file /Users/plewis/Documents/Projects/pdev/trunk/phycas/Tests/Data/green.nex

Performing path sampling MCMC to estimate marginal likelihood.
Likelihood will be raised to the power beta, and beta will be
decremented from 1.0 to 0.0 in a series of steps.
  No. steps:               5
  No. cycles per step:     100
  Sample every:            10
  No. samples per step:    10


Sampled trees will be saved in Filestream to trees.t
Sampled parameters will be saved in Filestream to params.p
Using standard MCMC (i.e. no uniformized mapping)
Tip node numbers were set using the names in the tree description
Creating one chain (i.e. not using heated chains to improve mixing)
Starting log-likelihood = -7731.10561438
Starting log-prior = 26.1380889715

Parameter starting values and prior densities:
  Parameter name:     master edge length parameter
  Prior distribution: Exponential(10.00000)
  Master parameter (no current value)
  Prior log-density:  26.1380889715

Topology prior:
  flat across all fully-resolved tree topologies (polytomies not allowed)

Sampling (100 cycles for each of the 5 values of beta)...
5 values were chosen from a discrete
Beta(1.00000, 1.00000) distribution:
     1      1.00000
     2      0.75000
     3      0.50000
     4      0.25000
     5      0.00000
An MCMC analysis will be performed exploring each of the
power posteriors defined by these values.
