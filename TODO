The TO DO list (put your initials beside items you add):
o (pol) implement MCMCImpl.explorePrior function to sample from the joint prior (slice samplers get bogged down when at least one prior is vague)
o (pol) model.edgelen_hyperparam should actually have some effect when it is set!
o (pol) separate internal and external edge length priors needs to be re-implemented
o (pol) finish implementing Metropolis-coupled chains
o (pol) allow data partitioning
o (pol) add a sump equivalent so that runs involving FLEXCAT model can be summarized
o (pol) need default constructors for each ProbabilityDistribution-derived class (see Examples/Paradox.py)
o (pol) slice_max_units needs to be 0 by default - too complicated to explain in examples (see Examples/Paradox.py) 
o (pol) finish implementing codon model
o (pol) need to be able to restart an analysis from where it left off
o (pol) transfer exception handling from C++ code to Python wrappers where possible, replacing exceptions	with asserts on the C++ site
