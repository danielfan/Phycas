Mark, this folder is misnamed. I should have called it something besides
"include" because it contains cpp files as well as header files. Perhaps
something like "pyconvert" would be better. The intention was to put here 
files from 3rd party libraries that, at least for the time being, are 
necessary for converting objects to and from Python.
