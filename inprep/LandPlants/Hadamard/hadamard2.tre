>    Likelihood settings:
>      Number of substitution types = 6

>        A=0.24569  C=0.24709  G=0.24660  T=0.26061
>      These settings correspond to the GTR+G model
>      Among-site rate variation:
>        Assumed proportion of invariable sites  = none
>        Distribution of rates at variable sites = gamma (discrete approximation)

>          Number of rate categories = 4
>          Representation of average rate for each category = mean
>      Number of distinct data patterns under this model = 631
>      Molecular clock not enforced
>      Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
>      Trees with approximate log likelihoods 5% or further from the target score are rejected

>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>    Addition sequence: as-is
>    Number of trees held at each step = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
>    Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if branch length is less than or equal to 1e-08
