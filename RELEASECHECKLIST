Release checklist:

In trunk/phycas/__init__.py:
	set release_version = True
	
Edit trunk/phycasver.txt to reflect the new version number

Edit setup.py to add any files that need to be included in distributions 
	(e.g. new Tests)
	
Build unix source distribution:
-------------------------------
These instructions assume that ncl is in $HOME/ndev and phycas is in
$HOME/pdev: i.e., I assume you did this at some point:
	mkdir $HOME/ndev
	cd $HOME/ndev
	svn co https://ncl.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ncl .
	mkdir $HOME/pdev
	cd $HOME/pdev
	svn co https://phycas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/phycas .
	
Make sure ncl directory is up-to-date:
	cd $HOME/ndev
	svn up
	
Make sure phycas directory is up-t0-date:
	cd $HOME/pdev
	svn up
	
Build and test phycas:
	cd $HOME/pdev/trunk
	./go.sh
	cd phycas/Tests
	python runall.py
	python doctestall.py
	
Create ncl tarball:
	Make a copy of the ncl source directory:
		cp -R $HOME/ndev/branches/v2.2/ncl $HOME/ncl-2.2.414
	Create a tarball of this copy:
		cd $HOME
		tar cvf ncl.tar ncl-2.2.414/*
		
Make sure $HOME/pdev/build.sh is accurate. If any changes are made, 
	commit them and update phycas at the highest level
	
Create phycas tarball:
	cd $HOME/pdev/trunk
	python build_linux_source.py
	
Concatentate the two tarballs so that users don't have to separately download NCL:
	TODO
