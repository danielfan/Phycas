Welcome to the MacOS version of Phycas!

We recommend dragging the Phycas application and manual.pdf file
to your Applications folder. Double-clicking the Phycas application
actually launches an iTerm (http://iterm.sourceforge.net/) terminal
session. You can begin using Phycas as soon as you see the Python
prompt. The manual.pdf file contains the user manual, which explains
how to use Phycas for Bayesian phylogeneic analyses.

You can get the latest version of Phycas from http://phycas.org/
