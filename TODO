The TO DO list (roughly in order of importance):
o run times overflow currently if the run is longer than about an hour, sometimes yielding negative run times!
o write a user manual and tutorial
o add a sumt equivalent so that runs involving polytomies can be easily summarized
o add a sump equivalent so that runs involving FLEXCAT model can be summarized
o should use kappa_prior rather than relrate_prior for HKY model (see Examples/Paradox.py)
o need default constructors for each ProbabilityDistribution-derived class (see Examples/Paradox.py)
o slice_max_units needs to be 0 by default - too complicated to explain in examples (see Examples/Paradox.py) 
o finish implementing codon model
o need to be able to restart an analysis from where it left off
o add ASCII tree drawing to Tree class
o add no-data run to test polytomy prior to existing Polytomy.py example
o add Metropolis-coupled chains
o allow data partitioning
o add Newton-Raphson for finding MLEs of edge lengths
o add Brent method for finding MLEs of model parameters
o add NNI, SPR and TBR branch swapping 
o ensure that slice sampler doesn't get stuck (e.g. no rate heterogeneity combined with vague prior on shape parameter)
o standard Mkv morphology model
o "episodic rates" version of the Mk model
o ensure that all routines called from python are represented in *.py wrappers
o transfer exception handling from C++ code to Python wrappers where possible, replacing exceptions	with asserts on the C++ site
