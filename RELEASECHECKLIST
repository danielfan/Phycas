Release checklist:

These instructions assume that ncl is in $HOME/ndev and phycas is in
$HOME/pdev: i.e., I assume you did this at some point:
	mkdir $HOME/ndev
	cd $HOME/ndev
	svn co https://ncl.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ncl .
	mkdir $HOME/pdev
	cd $HOME/pdev
	svn co https://phycas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/phycas .
	
In trunk/phycas/__init__.py:
	set release_version = True
	
Edit trunk/phycasver.txt to reflect the new version number

Edit setup.py and MANIFEST.in to add any files that need to be included in 
	distributions (e.g. new Tests)
	
Building the manual:
--------------------
Edit $HOME/pdev/trunk/documentation/users/manual.tex as needed, adding information on
new features and bugs fixed in the current version, then do this to build manual.pdf:
	cd $HOME/pdev/trunk/documentation/users
	python regenerate_inputs.py
	./rebuild.sh
	
Build unix source distribution:
-------------------------------
Make sure ncl directory is up-to-date:
	cd $HOME/ndev
	svn up
	
Make sure phycas directory is up-to-date:
	cd $HOME/pdev
	svn up
	
Build and test phycas:
	cd $HOME/pdev/trunk
	./go.sh
	cd phycas/Tests
	python runall.py
	python doctestall.py
	
Create a tarball containing the v2.2 branch of NCL:
	Make a copy of the ncl source directory:
		cp -R $HOME/ndev/branches/v2.2 $HOME/ncl-2.2.414
	Delete the bin and .svn directories from $HOME/ncl-2.2.414
		cd $HOME/ncl-2.2.414
		rm -rf bin
		find . -name ".svn" -exec rm -rf {} \;
	Create a tarball of this copy:
		cd $HOME
		tar cvf ncl.tar ncl-2.2.414/*
		
Make sure $HOME/pdev/build.sh is accurate. If any changes are made, 
	commit them and update phycas at the highest level
	
Create phycas tarball (will be in $HOME/pdev/trunk/dist when done):
	cd $HOME/pdev/trunk
	./build_linux_source_distr.sh
	
Concatentate the two tarballs so that users don't have to separately download NCL:
	cd $HOME/pdev/trunk/dist
	gunzip Phycas-1.1.1.1036.tar.gz
	tar --concatenate -f Phycas-1.1.1.1036.tar $HOME/ncl.tar
	gzip Phycas-1.1.1.1036.tar.gz

Creating MacOS version:
-----------------------
Make sure pdev is up-to-date, then do this:
	cd $HOME/pdev/trunk/installer/mac/iterm
	./refill_phycas_gui_app.sh
	
Creating Win32 version:
-----------------------
To create versions for different releases of Python, I normally just use different machines
set up with the different Python versions (you are on your own if you want to create phycas
versions targetting different python versions all within one machine!).

"svn update" both ndev and pdev directories

Be sure these environmental variables are set (here are my settings):
	BOOST_ROOT=C:\Users\Administrator\Library\boost_1_37_0
	NCL_INSTALL_DIR=C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\ndev\branches\v2.2

Build phycas: from pdev/trunk, type
	bjam release
	
Edit the pdev/trunk/build_windows_installer.bat to specify Python target version

Double-click pdev/trunk/build_windows_installer.bat file to build Phycas installer,
	which will appear in the pdev/trunk/dist directory when finished
