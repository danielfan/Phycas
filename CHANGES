~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Release history (most recent first) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Release 1.1.4 (8-Apr-2009)
- harmonic mean estimate of marginal likelihood is no longer computed after an MCMC run
  (use sump command for this)
- several small bugs were fixed in the sim command (still some glitches left, I fear)

Release 1.1.3 (15-Mar-2009)
- this number was used for some Python-version-specific Mac releases
  that are really 1.1.2 code

Release 1.1.2 (13-Mar-2009)
- subversion revisions for this release:
	1047 Mac
	1049 Linux
	1049 Win for Python 2.5
	1047 Win for Python 2.6
- fixed 3rd. underflow-related bug

Release 1.1.1 (12-Mar-2009)
- subversion revisions for this release:
	1052 Mac
	1052 Linux
	1052 Win for Python 2.5
	1053 Win for Python 2.6
- fixed 2 underflow-related bugs

Release 1.1.0 (11-Feb-2009)
- the subversion revision number for this release is 1020
- added the ps command, which does path sampling (a.k.a. thermodynamic integration)
  and steppingstone sampling (new method) for estimating marginal likelihood
- added sump command, which currently computes just basic summary statistics given
  a param file output from an mcmc or ps analysis
- changed model.base_freqs and model.base_freq_param_prior to model.state_freqs 
  and model.state_freq_param_prior, respectively
- added model.update_freqs_separately and model.state_freq_prior to allow joint
  updates of all state frequencies. If model.update_freqs_separately = True, each
  frequency parameter is updated separately by slice sampling (old way) and the
  model.state_freq_param_prior is applied to each one individually; if False, 
  the state frequencies are updated jointly using a Metropolis move and the joint
  prior model.state_freq_prior is applied to the entire vector of state freqs
- two memory leaks were fixed prior to this release (see "leaky" bug in BUGS file).

Release 1.0.0 (5-Aug-2008)
This was the first official release at the Woods Hole Molecular Evolution Workshop.
