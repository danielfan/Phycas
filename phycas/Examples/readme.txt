This folder contains examples of analyses that can be performed using
Phycas. They are designed to show you how to use Phycas for actual
analyses. In general, these replicate an analysis described in a 
published paper, so they are set up to run long enough that 
the results are comparable with those given in the publication.
You are welcome of course to tweak these, including changing the
number of cycles to make them run faster, but be aware that doing so
might have deleterious effects on the results.
