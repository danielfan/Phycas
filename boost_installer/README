This directory holds scripts for creating installers for the libboost_python
	shared object library that Phycas relies on.
	
On Windows this is not needed because Paul has figured out how to move the
	DLL to an appropriate places during Phycas' installation procedure.

On Linux we will require users to build and install libboost_python first.

On Mac we will distribute an dmg file that has an installer that puts the 
	library in /usr/local/lib/

Unfortunately this needs to be compiled for both PowerPC and Intel and for each 
	supported version of python.
